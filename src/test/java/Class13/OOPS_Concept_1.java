     * OOP Concept:
     *
     *  1. Encapsulation:
     *      Wrapping up the code in a class.
     *      To implement/practice Encapsulation concept, we create Class and write code in it.
     *
     *  2. Abstraction:
     *      Hiding unnecessary information from the user.
     *      To implement/practice Abstraction concept, we create methods in our code.
     *
     *  3. Inheritance
     *      To implement/practice Inheritance concept, we create parent-child relation between two Java-classes.
     *      -> to create parent-child relation between two classes, we use "extends" keyword with child-Class
     *      -> child-Class get all variables/methods of parent-Class
     *      -> child-Class-object can be used to access method/variables from child-Class and parent-Class
     *
     *  4. Polymorphism
     *      same name but different forms
     *      To implement/practice Polymorphism concept, we create multiple methods with same name but different input-parameters.
     *      Types:
     *          -> Compile Time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading)
     *          -> Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding)
     *
     *      Compile Time Polymorphism (Static Binding or Method Overloading):
     *          when in a class, we create two or more methods with same name but different input-parameters.
     *          Ways to set-up different input-parameters:
     *              1. different number of input-parameters
     *              2. different types of input-parameters
     *              3. different sequence of input-parameters
     *
     *      Run Time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding or Method Overriding):
     *          can ONLY exist in Inheritance set-up
     *          when we have method with same-name and same-input-parameters in ParentClass and ChildClass
